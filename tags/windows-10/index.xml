      <description>This is not officially support by Microsoft
Your probably wondering, why would you deploy windows 10 using the application model? why not use the feature update in SCCM?
Well that would worked for still in service versions of windows 10 however if you are running an older version of windows 10, and deploy this feature update, SCCM can mark it as compliant and never install the Feature update.
like wise why not use the upgrade task sequence?</description>

      <description>This was discovered when i was looking for a way to speed up login times for windows 10.
We already looked removing the universal apps that ship with windows 10, and a few other tricks here or there to get log in time to down from 1:20 to 30 - 50 seconds. still that is good from what i have read online.
however while we was implementing VMware Horizon i wondered if the log in time could be decreased even further.</description>
