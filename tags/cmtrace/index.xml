      <description>This is the method i use to make sure every machine has Cmtrace.
Cmtrace is a tool to read log files, very handy when troubleshooting SCCM logs, or any other logs for that matter.
You can read more about CMtrace here: Configuration Manager Tools - CMTrace
I use the application model to install during operating system deployment (OSD).
And i also create a deployment to All workstations to make sure its installed incase a user removes it.</description>
