      <description>Scenario You don&amp;rsquo;t want to use UEM/DEM, and you want files made avaibile to the user when they sign in. Or you have some files you need to get out to endpoints and don&amp;rsquo;t want to write a script to copy the files from the SCCM cache to the location. Sometimes you have to do things outside ofthe box. However these file don&amp;rsquo;t install they just need to be copied to a directory, such as the default/public desktop.</description>

      <description>Scenario I was tasked with remoting installing a font on thousands on endpoints. I thought this should be easy, as surly their is a command line way to do this.
I was wrong&amp;hellip;.
There was a command line tool to install font files from the command however it was deprecated and removed.
However you are not stuck with making API calls in user context to get the Font file installed.</description>
