      <description>Scenario I was tasked with remoting installing a font on thousands on endpoints. I thought this should be easy, as surly their is a command line way to do this.
I was wrong&amp;hellip;.
There was a command line tool to install font files from the command however it was deprecated and removed.
However you are not stuck with making API calls in user context to get the Font file installed.</description>
