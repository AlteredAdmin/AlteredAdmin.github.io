      <description>Scenario You don&amp;rsquo;t want to use UEM/DEM, and you want files made avaibile to the user when they sign in. Or you have some files you need to get out to endpoints and don&amp;rsquo;t want to write a script to copy the files from the SCCM cache to the location. Sometimes you have to do things outside ofthe box. However these file don&amp;rsquo;t install they just need to be copied to a directory, such as the default/public desktop.</description>

      <description>Lets say you need to copy files to a location on the endpoint. that can be done using the SCCM application model in SCCM. this way you can confirm that the file and/or folders are on the endpoint at the end.
One can do this Via PowerShell or batch file. I like to run the below command from a batch file, In the application i added the Batch file to the installation Program, this way i can add more commands to the process is needed.</description>
