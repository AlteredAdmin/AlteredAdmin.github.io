      <description>This is the method i use to make sure every machine has Cmtrace.
Cmtrace is a tool to read log files, very handy when troubleshooting SCCM logs, or any other logs for that matter.
You can read more about CMtrace here: Configuration Manager Tools - CMTrace
I use the application model to install during operating system deployment (OSD).
And i also create a deployment to All workstations to make sure its installed incase a user removes it.</description>

      <description>Scenario You don&amp;rsquo;t want to use UEM/DEM, and you want files made avaibile to the user when they sign in. Or you have some files you need to get out to endpoints and don&amp;rsquo;t want to write a script to copy the files from the SCCM cache to the location. Sometimes you have to do things outside ofthe box. However these file don&amp;rsquo;t install they just need to be copied to a directory, such as the default/public desktop.</description>

      <description>For our environment we needed a inexpensive way to print barcodes, that was not tied to unique licensed software.
our current barcodes are using code 39 format.
what we decided to try to use a Dymo Label Printer
LabelWriter 450 Direct Thermal Label Printer
And we fond labels that where not far off from our current size.

      <guid>/posts/feature-update-windows-10-using-sccm-application-model/</guid>
      <description>This is not officially support by Microsoft
Your probably wondering, why would you deploy windows 10 using the application model? why not use the feature update in SCCM?
Well that would worked for still in service versions of windows 10 however if you are running an older version of windows 10, and deploy this feature update, SCCM can mark it as compliant and never install the Feature update.
like wise why not use the upgrade task sequence?</description>

      <description>Scenario I was tasked with remoting installing a font on thousands on endpoints. I thought this should be easy, as surly their is a command line way to do this.
I was wrong&amp;hellip;.
There was a command line tool to install font files from the command however it was deprecated and removed.
However you are not stuck with making API calls in user context to get the Font file installed.</description>

      <description>This was discovered when i was looking for a way to speed up login times for windows 10.
We already looked removing the universal apps that ship with windows 10, and a few other tricks here or there to get log in time to down from 1:20 to 30 - 50 seconds. still that is good from what i have read online.
however while we was implementing VMware Horizon i wondered if the log in time could be decreased even further.</description>

      <description>In this case I&amp;rsquo;m using JAMF, and putting the extracting the files to the administrator desktop.
You will need to prestage the files on the computer. You can use Composer to create a DMG or PKG to extract the files on the endpoint.

      <description>Lets say you need to copy files to a location on the endpoint. that can be done using the SCCM application model in SCCM. this way you can confirm that the file and/or folders are on the endpoint at the end.
One can do this Via PowerShell or batch file. I like to run the below command from a batch file, In the application i added the Batch file to the installation Program, this way i can add more commands to the process is needed.</description>

      <description>Scenario You have a mix bag of Office 2019 and Office 2016 installs some are 32 or 64bit. You need to create a Device collections in SCCM that reflects what machines have which office version installed and what bitness as well.
What i tried: My first instinct was to create a device collection using a combination of the below queries:
select distinct SMS_R_System.ResourceId, SMS_R_System.ResourceType, SMS_R_System.Name, SMS_R_System.SMSUniqueIdentifier, SMS_R_System.ResourceDomainORWorkgroup, SMS_R_System.Client from SMS_R_System inner join SMS_G_System_ADD_REMOVE_PROGRAMS on SMS_G_System_ADD_REMOVE_PROGRAMS.</description>
