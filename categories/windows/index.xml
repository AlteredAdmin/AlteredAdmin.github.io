      <description>This was discovered when i was looking for a way to speed up login times for windows 10.
We already looked removing the universal apps that ship with windows 10, and a few other tricks here or there to get log in time to down from 1:20 to 30 - 50 seconds. still that is good from what i have read online.
however while we was implementing VMware Horizon i wondered if the log in time could be decreased even further.</description>
